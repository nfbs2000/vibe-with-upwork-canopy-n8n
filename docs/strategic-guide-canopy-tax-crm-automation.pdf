(Strategic Guide for Canopy Tax CRM Automation) Tj
T*
(Overcoming API Limitations & Defining Operational Processes) Tj
T*
(Prepared by: Yunho) Tj
T*
T*
(Status: Pre-implementation Analysis) Tj
T*
T*
(1. The Technical Reality) Tj
T*
(After analyzing the Canopy Tax Public API \(v3\), the following fact is confirmed:) Tj
T*
T*
(No Direct File Trigger: The API does NOT provide any way to automatically detect or "push") Tj
T*
(a signal when a client uploads a file.) Tj
T*
T*
(Vendor Restriction: This is a strategic limitation by Canopy. Therefore, we cannot rely on) Tj
T*
(the API alone to know when a file exists.) Tj
T*
T*
(2. Two Operational Solutions \(Decision Required\)) Tj
T*
(To bridge this gap, you must choose one of the following two "signal" methods:) Tj
T*
T*
(Option A: Manual Field Update \(The "Status" Method\)) Tj
T*
(How it works: Your staff must manually update a "Custom Field" in Canopy \(e.g., set File) Tj
T*
(Status to 'Uploaded'\) after they see a file.) Tj
T*
T*
(Pros: High accuracy since a human verifies it first.) Tj
T*
T*
(Cons: High risk of human error. If staff forget to update the field, the automation never) Tj
T*
(starts.) Tj
T*
T*
(Option B: Email-to-Webhook \(The "Sensor" Method\) - Recommended) Tj
T*
(How it works: We turn on Canopy's "Client uploads a file" email notification. My system) Tj
T*
(\(n8n\) acts as a digital sensor that "listens" to your inbox and triggers the automation.) Tj
T*
T*
(Pros: Much closer to full automation. No extra steps for your staff in the CRM.) Tj
T*
T*
(Cons: Canopy emails are inconsistent. They mix Portal uploads, Secure Link uploads, and) Tj
T*
(other alerts. Designing a precise filter to separate these takes significant development) Tj
T*
(and testing time.) Tj
T*
T*
(3. Recommended Workflow: The "Human-in-the-loop" Filter) Tj
T*
(Because the API is unreliable, 100% full automation might send wrong messages to clients.) Tj
T*
(I recommend this Hybrid Process:) Tj
T*
T*
(Signal: Canopy sends an email alert \(Option B\).) Tj
T*
T*
(Processing: n8n parses the email to find the Client ID and details.) Tj
T*
T*
(Verification \(The Filter\): The system asks a staff member \(via a simple button or link\) to) Tj
T*
("Approve" the notification.) Tj
T*
T*
(Final Action: Once approved, the KakaoTalk/Email is sent to the client.) Tj
T*
T*
(4. Why This Requires Significant Time) Tj
T*
(This project is not about "connecting dots"; it is about "refining raw, unreliable data) Tj
T*
(into a stable business process.") Tj

(Pattern Analysis: We must analyze various Canopy email subjects and bodies to ensure the) Tj
T*
("sensor" works every time.) Tj
T*
T*
(Exception Handling: We must build logic for multiple file uploads, missing client names,) Tj
T*
(or delayed emails.) Tj
T*
T*
(Operational SOP: We need to align your staff's behavior with the system's logic.) Tj
T*
T*
(5. Conclusion) Tj
T*
(The success of this project depends on process over code. Please decide if you prefer the) Tj
T*
(Manual Update \(A\) or Email Sensor \(B\) model so we can define the final scope.) Tj
